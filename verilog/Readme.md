Verilog examples

01:  Verilog hello wold. Very useful for testing if the icaros verilog is working properly

02: Simulation example. Very useful for testing if gtkwave is working ok

03: Sintetis example (taken from the arachne-PRN project). Check that all the toolchain for sinthesis is ok!

04: My first fully example: a NOT gate. A simple project that can  be simulated and / or sinthetized
